Instructions

1. Install the .Net Core SDK
2. Install the single page templates by running the command
   "  dotnet new --install Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates::*  "
3. To see the templates avaialable for you to use use the command:
    " dotnet new  "

So the above instructions 2 and 3 help us create new ASP.Net SPA templates that is ASP.NET: 
     a) Web application, 
     b) Aurelia, 
     c) Knockout.js , 
     d) Vue.js , 
     e) Web API . 

There is an alternative to creating these templates that is using YEOMAN. 

1st we must install Yoeman globally into our machine

3a. To create the templates using YOEMAN we use the command:
   "  npm install -g yo generator-aspnetcore-spa  "

3b.  Now we can "Scaffold" the ASP.Net Template using Yoeman:
   " yo aspnetcore-spa"

4. Now we scaffold our project using one of the given templates:
   
	 i) Create a directory for your project.
	ii) Create a 3 more directories that we will us to scaffold different application templates thus
		a. Angular 
		b. React
		c. React and Redux
5. Now to scaffold a new angular project, 
change directory to the directory of the one maching you dont mind keeping

6. write the command:
      " dotnet new angular "
	- Make sure you have Dot Net Core SDK version 2.0 or later.

To run our project from the command line we must first restore both dotnet and npm dependencies.

7. To restore the Dot Net dependencies we will run:
	" dotnet restore  "

8. To restore our NPM dependencies we must run:
	" npm  install"

Now scaffold the other templates like the React, React and Redux into their respective folders.ls
 
9. Now to run the application via command line we use
	"  dotnet run"
	- Application will be executed on localhost:5000.
